# Image-Classifier-Keras

That's the question that this convolutional neural network is supposed to answer. It is my experiment with the classic [Dogs vs. Cats Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition).

Recommendation:
1. Run in Google Collabs
    or
2. Run using CUDA in local device
